		<h2 class="p2">What is an Advocacy</h2>
		<p class="p">What is advocacy? Merriam-Webster defines an advocate as someone who “argues for or supports a cause or policy.” Other definitions paint advocates as defenders, either of a cause or of a person. Lastly, an advocate can also be defined as a promoter of another’s interests. Advocacy is taking action to support a cause or proposal. It encompasses educating and mobilizing citizens, and it involves them in developing and promoting policies they care about. We can ease human suffering and help millions of people through advocacy that changes unjust policies or systems.</p>

		<h2 class="p2">What is our advocacy about?</h2>
		<p class="p">
		Our advocacy is primarily focused on providing families in poverty with food and clothes. Sometimes schools donate books for the children to read and we're responsible on making sure the books get to the families. We believe that as ambassadors of Jesus, we are called to build relationships with community and government leaders around the world. Together, we champion positive change that helps end all forms of human poverty. We walk with public servants in order to speak into legislation, policies, systems and attitudes that impact global poverty. Through these relationships and influence, we seek justice and renewal in vulnerable communities, so God’s purpose is revealed in each person we serve.

		<h2 class="p2">History</h2>
		<p class="p">
			The world has made huge strides in overcoming global poverty. Since 1990, more than 1.2 billion people have risen out of extreme poverty. Now, 9.2% of the world survives on less than $1.90 a day, compared to nearly 36% in 1990.<br><br>
			But the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to reverse years of progress in the fight against global poverty and income inequalities, and it jeopardizes the future of a generation of children.<br><br>
			COVID-19 drove an additional 97 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, according to World Bank estimates. More than a year into the pandemic, the World Bank stresses that “there is still much we don’t know” concerning its impact on global poverty in 2021.<br><br>
			When families move out of poverty, children’s health and well-being improve. Since 1990, the number of children under the age of 5 dying — mostly from preventable causes such as poverty, hunger, and disease — is less than half of what it was, dropping from about 34,200 a day to over 14,200.<br><br>
			World Vision is committed to ending extreme poverty by 2030 and laying the foundation for every child to experience Jesus’ promise of life in all its fullness (John 10:10). Though eradicating global poverty is hard, particularly in fragile contexts, World Vision believes there is reason to hope.
